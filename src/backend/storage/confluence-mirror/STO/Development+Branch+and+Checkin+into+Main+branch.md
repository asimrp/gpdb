-   **Development branch** for the feature is //cdb2/private/filerep/..
-   **Check-in into main branch**
    -   Matt will do the check-in into main for enhancement that make create/drop database and create/drop table fully transactional. That is necessary since that functionality is required also for "tablespaces" feature.
    -   Online resynchronization feature will be checked in into main after feature is fully implemented and ensured that no regression is introduced ("cdbfast" test harness should complete successfully in private "filerep" branch.). That is in december after Milestone 3.
        The criteria for check-in into main is to not introduce regression.
